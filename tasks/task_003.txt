# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Code Quality Tools and Pre-commit Hooks
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up code formatting tools and pre-commit hooks to maintain code quality throughout development.
# Details:
1. Install ESLint and configure rules
2. Set up Prettier for code formatting
3. Install and configure husky for Git hooks
4. Set up lint-staged to run formatting on modified files
5. Configure pre-commit hooks to run linting and formatting
6. Add npm scripts for manual formatting and linting
7. Create documentation on code style guidelines
8. Ensure TypeScript strict mode is properly configured

# Test Strategy:
Make an unformatted code change and attempt to commit. Verify the pre-commit hook formats the code before allowing the commit. Run linting manually to ensure rules are properly enforced.
