# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement E2E Testing with Playwright for Next.js Portfolio
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up Playwright for end-to-end testing and implement test suites covering critical user flows in the portfolio website.
# Details:
1. Install Playwright and configure it for the Next.js project:
   - Run `npm init playwright@latest` to set up Playwright
   - Configure Playwright to work with Next.js in the `playwright.config.ts` file
   - Set up appropriate viewport sizes for desktop, tablet, and mobile testing

2. Create the following test suites:
   - Navigation tests: Verify all header links navigate to correct sections
   - Projects section tests: Test filtering functionality and project card display
   - Theme switching tests: Verify theme toggle works and persists between sessions
   - Responsive design tests: Check layout integrity across different viewport sizes
   - Content verification tests: Ensure all major sections (Hero, Skills, About, Contact) display correct content

3. Implement test utilities:
   - Create helper functions for common operations
   - Set up test fixtures for consistent testing environments
   - Implement screenshot comparison for visual regression testing

4. Integrate with development workflow:
   - Add npm scripts for running tests locally
   - Configure tests to run in CI pipeline
   - Set up reporting for test results

5. Document testing approach and how to run/maintain tests in README.md

# Test Strategy:
Verify implementation by:

1. Running the full test suite with `npm run test:e2e` and confirming all tests pass

2. Validate specific test coverage:
   - Check that all critical user flows are covered in test files
   - Verify tests run in all specified browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
   - Confirm tests run at different viewport sizes

3. Test the CI integration:
   - Push a commit that should pass all tests
   - Push a commit with an intentional UI change that should fail tests
   - Verify test reports are generated correctly

4. Manual verification:
   - Review test code for best practices and maintainability
   - Ensure tests are not flaky by running the suite multiple times
   - Check that visual comparison tests have appropriate tolerance settings

5. Documentation check:
   - Verify README includes clear instructions for running and maintaining tests
   - Confirm all custom test utilities are documented
