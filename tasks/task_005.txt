# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Three.js Background Animation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a subtle, visually appealing Three.js background animation using react-three/fiber and react-three/drei with spring-based easing effects, and implement complementary UI animations for portfolio sections using framer-motion.
# Details:
1. Set up a Canvas component from react-three/fiber
2. Create a low-polygon geometric scene (floating particles or abstract shapes)
3. Implement spring-based easing animations using @react-spring/three
4. Add mouse/scroll interaction with smooth transitions
5. Optimize performance with instanced meshes and proper object disposal
6. Add configuration options for animation parameters
7. Implement reduced motion settings for accessibility
8. Create responsive behavior for different screen sizes
9. Add fallback static background for browsers without WebGL
10. Ensure proper z-indexing with page content
11. Implement framer-motion for UI animations across portfolio sections:
    a. Create fade-in animations on scroll for section content
    b. Add hover effects for interactive elements
    c. Design smooth transitions between sections
    d. Implement staggered animations for list items in Skills section
    e. Create subtle animations for Project cards
12. Ensure UI animations complement the Three.js background:
    a. Use consistent timing and easing functions
    b. Create visual harmony between background and foreground animations
    c. Avoid conflicting or competing animations
13. Apply the same accessibility considerations to UI animations:
    a. Honor reduced motion preferences
    b. Ensure animations don't interfere with usability
14. Optimize animation performance across both systems

# Test Strategy:
Test animation performance across browsers and devices. Verify smooth transitions and 60fps rendering. Check accessibility with reduced motion preferences and ensure the animation doesn't interfere with content interaction. Test UI animations for consistency with the Three.js background. Verify that animations enhance rather than distract from the user experience. Test all animations with both mouse and touch interactions.
