# Task ID: 11
# Title: Fix Active Section Indicator Styling in Sticky Header
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Resolve styling issues with the active section indicator in the sticky header where the correct state logic exists but the visual styles (bg-primary, text-primary-foreground) are not being applied correctly.
# Details:
The Header.tsx component correctly identifies the active section, but the visual styling for the active button is not rendering properly. The developer should:

1. Examine the current CSS implementation in Header.tsx for the active section button
2. Check for CSS specificity issues where other styles might be overriding the active state styles
3. Verify that Tailwind classes (bg-primary, text-primary-foreground) are being properly processed and included in the final CSS output
4. Look for potential class conflicts or incorrect class application in the component hierarchy
5. Ensure that conditional class application logic is working correctly (e.g., className={`${isActive ? 'bg-primary text-primary-foreground' : ''}`})
6. Check if there are any parent elements with styles that might be interfering with the active button styles
7. Verify that the Tailwind configuration includes the proper theme settings for primary colors
8. Consider using more specific selectors or !important flags as a last resort if specificity issues can't be resolved otherwise
9. Update the styling implementation to ensure the active section is visually distinct with the intended background and text colors

# Test Strategy:
To verify the fix has been properly implemented:

1. Visual inspection: Navigate through different sections of the site and confirm the active section in the sticky header is visually highlighted with the correct background color (bg-primary) and text color (text-primary-foreground)
2. Cross-browser testing: Verify the styling works correctly across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
3. Responsive testing: Check that the active indicator displays correctly at various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
4. State transition testing: Scroll between different sections and verify the active indicator smoothly transitions between buttons
5. Inspect element verification: Use browser dev tools to confirm the correct classes are being applied to the active element
6. CSS specificity check: Verify through dev tools that no other styles are overriding the active state styles
7. Regression testing: Ensure fixing this issue hasn't affected other header functionality or styling
8. Dark/light mode testing: If the site supports different themes, verify the active indicator works correctly in all theme modes
