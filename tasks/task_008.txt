# Description: Implement a theme switching mechanism for toggling between light and dark modes.
# Details:
1. Set up theme context using React context API

3. Implement theme persistence using localStorage
4. Ensure all components respond correctly to theme changes
5. Add smooth transition animations between themes
6. Respect user system preferences for initial theme
7. Test theme consistency across all pages and components
8. Ensure proper contrast ratios for accessibility in both themes
