# Technical Architecture  
## System Components
- Next.js App Router for routing and server components
- React components for UI building blocks
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Form handling with React Hook Form
- State management with React Context API or Zustand (for more complex state)

## Data Models
- Project: id, title, description, technologies, image, links, featured status
- Experience: company, role, duration, description, technologies
- Skill: name, proficiency, category
- Blog Post: title, content, date, tags, excerpt
- Contact Message: name, email, message, date

## APIs and Integrations
- Email service integration for contact form (e.g., SendGrid, Nodemailer)
- GitHub API integration for showcasing repositories
- Content management via local Markdown files or a headless CMS

## Infrastructure Requirements
- Vercel deployment for hosting
- GitHub for version control
- Image optimization with Next.js Image component
- Environment variables for API keys and sensitive information

# Development Roadmap  
## MVP Requirements
1. Responsive landing page with personal introduction
2. Navigation system with smooth scrolling to sections
3. Projects section with at least 3 featured projects
4. Skills and experience section
5. Basic contact form
6. Dark/light mode toggle
7. Deployment to Vercel

## Future Enhancements
1. Blog/articles section with Markdown support
2. Advanced project filtering and search
3. Animated page transitions
4. Interactive skill visualization
5. Multi-language support
6. Analytics integration
7. Testimonials section
8. GitHub integration to automatically display repositories

# Logical Dependency Chain
1. Setup and Configuration
   - Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
   - Configure Tailwind CSS
   - Set up project structure and layouts

2. Core Components
   - Header/navigation component
   - Footer component
   - Layout wrapper
   - Theme toggle

3. Main Sections Implementation
   - Hero/introduction section
   - Projects grid and project card components
   - Skills and experience section
   - Contact form with validation

4. Styling and Responsiveness
   - Implement responsive design for all screen sizes
   - Apply consistent styling and animations
   - Implement dark/light mode

5. Deployment and Optimization
   - Setup Vercel deployment
   - Optimize images and assets
   - Implement SEO best practices

# Risks and Mitigations  
## Technical Challenges
- Performance optimization: Use Next.js image optimization, code splitting, and lazy loading
- Form handling and security: Implement server-side validation and rate limiting
- Browser compatibility: Test across multiple browsers and implement polyfills if necessary

## MVP Scope
- Focus on core sections first (intro, projects, skills, contact)
- Implement a minimal viable design that can be enhanced later
- Use placeholder content initially to speed up development

## Resource Constraints
- Utilize pre-built components when appropriate
- Leverage Tailwind CSS for faster styling
- Implement features incrementally to maintain momentum

# Appendix  
## Design Inspiration
- Minimalist portfolio websites with focus on content
- Modern UI trends including glassmorphism, subtle animations
- Accessible color schemes that work in both dark and light modes

## Technical References
- Next.js documentation
- Tailwind CSS best practices
- WCAG accessibility guidelines
